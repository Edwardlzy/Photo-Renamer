# Photo-Renamer

Big thanks to Hayley Lin who worked with me together on this project.

This program provides users a GUI to select and view photos from their file system and
allows them to add/delete tags to the photos, which would change the name of the photos
in their file system.

Revert to a specific timestamp is supported.
